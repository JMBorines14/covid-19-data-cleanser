This script was used to clean the DOH Covid-19 data drop CSV file, by applying the following changes:
<ol>
  <li> Creating a new column <i> Repatriate </i> if the Region of Residence of a Covid-19 patient is "ROF" </li>
  <li> Changing the format of the Age Group column (e.g. from '0 to 4' to '00 to 04') </li>
  <li> Changing the format of the Region of Residence column to a specified format (e.g. from 'Region I: Ilocos Region' to '01 - Region 1') </li>
  <li> Changing the format of date columns </li>
  <li> Replacing Ã‘ with N </li>
</ol>
